# Talkvers chat Application

Talkvers is a real-time chat application that transates messages between users, so that users speaking different languages can message each other without a language barrier. Using talkvers a user will be able to pick his/her prefered language so that he/she can recive a translation to that language along with incoming messages.
Talkverse is web application and is built with the MERN stack. For real-time communication it utilizes socket.io and it translates users mesages using Google api studio's Gemini 1.5 pro model.
